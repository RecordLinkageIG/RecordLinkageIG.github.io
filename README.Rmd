## About

This repository hosts the blog of the American Statistical Association's [Record Linkage Interest Group (RLIG)](https://sites.google.com/view/rlig). 

The blog is open to contributions from anyone with interest in deterministic and probabilistic record linkage, entity resolution, data fusion, and statistical matching. See below for contribution instructions.

```


#### Some stats

- RLIG's blog has **`r nrow(posts)`** posts since **`r min(lubridate::as_date(dates))`**.

- The last post was published **`r days_last_post`** days ago ([`r titles[1]`](`r links[1]`)).


```{r plot-obj, fig.height=1, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
# Create plot object
posts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lubridate::as_date(dates), y = 1)) +
  geom_point(shape = "|", size = 5,   color = "#f95355") + 
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # creates the light gray box around the plot ----
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(0, 10, 0, 10)
  ) +
  ggtitle("Published posts history")
```

## Contribute

The blog is based on [Distill for Rmarkdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), an [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) extension for scientific and technical writing on the web.

There are two ways to contribute to this blog:

1. Contact [Olivier Binette](https://olivierbinette.github.io/) to get a blog post published from any source. This blog post can be written in text format, markdown format, rmarkdown format, or another format without complicated formatting.
2. If you have familiarity with Rmarkdown and Github, you can follow the steps below to directly contribute to the blog. 

### System configuration

We recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) as an IDE for its visual rmarkdown editor and suite of compatible editing features. If you do not have RStudio, you will need to separately install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to render Rmarkdown documents. You will need R and to install the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "distill"))
```

### Creating a new post

Follow these steps to create a new post:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new RStudio project from version control, using the forked repository url. Alternatively, clone the forked repository and `cd` into it.
3. Use the following R command to create a new post:

```r
distill::create_post("My Post Title")
```

4. This will create a new folder, named after the current date and provided post title, in the `_posts` directory. This folder contains an Rmarkdown document for you to edit.
5. Edit the Rmarkdown document, referring to [https://rstudio.github.io/distill/](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) for help with formatting and metadata options. You may also use previous posts as templates.
6. Run the following R command to render your blog post as an html file:

```r
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

7. Commit, push, and create a pull request on [https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io](https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io).

The pull request will be reviewed before your post is published on RLIG's blog.
