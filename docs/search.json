If you are not familiar with these tools, contact Olivier Binette to help adapt your blog post. We recommend using RStudio as an IDE for its visual rmarkdown editor and suite of compatible editing features. If you do not have RStudio, you will need to separately install Pandoc to render Rmarkdown documents.\nSystem configuration\nMake sure you have R and RStudio installed (you can separately install Pandoc instead of RStudio). You will also need to install the following packages in R:\ninstall.packages(c(\"rmarkdown\", \"distill\"))\nCreating a new post\nFollow these steps to create a new post:\nFork the Github repository https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io\nCreate a new RStudio project from version control, using the forked repository url. Alternatively, clone the forked repository and cd into it.\nUse the following R command to create a new post:\ndistill::create_post(\"My Post Title\")\nThis will create a new folder, named after the current date and provided post title, in the _posts directory. This folder contains an Rmarkdown document for you to edit.\nEdit the Rmarkdown document, referring to https://rstudio.github.io/distill/ for help with formatting and metadata options. You may also use previous posts as templates.\nRun the following R command to render your blog post as an html file:\nrmarkdown::render_site()\nCommit, push, and create a pull request on https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io.\nThe pull request will be reviewed before your post is published on RLIG’s blog.\nSubmission requirements checklist\nMake sure to review the following items before submitting your post.\nAs part of your article’s metadata, you should use the template below to provide:\nPost title and description\nCurrent date\nImage preview\nAuthor information (full name, url/email address, and affiliation)\n\ntitle: \"My Post Title\"\ndescription: |\n  Description of my post.\npreview: http://website.com/post-image\nauthor:\n  - name: Full Name\n    url: url.com\n    affiliation: State University\ndate: 2022-01-01\nAt the end of your article, as part of the appendix, you should provide as section titled “About the Author(s)” which contains a short bibliography or some information regarding your background and interests.
