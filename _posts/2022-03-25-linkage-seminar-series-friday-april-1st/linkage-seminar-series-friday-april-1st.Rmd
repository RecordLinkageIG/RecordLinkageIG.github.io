 Roee Gutman will present work that view record linkage as a missing data problem and he will describe Bayesian procedures that utilize data features that are frequently encountered in public health applications. These procedures improve the linkage, and result in more accurate and precise estimates of scientifically important associations. The first procedure incorporates associations between variables exclusive to one of the datasets in the linkage process. The second procedure ensures that individuals receiving care from the same provider in one file are linked to individuals receiving care from a similar provider in the other file. Roee will demonstrate these procedures using two applications: one combines Medicare claims records and Vital Statistics Mortality records to study the association between end-of-life medical expenses and causes of death. A second application combines records from the National Trauma Databank with Medicare claims data to study the relationship between injury characteristics and successful discharge to the community among patients with traumatic brain injury.

This seminar will be recorded and resources will be [posted online](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/resources/linkage-project-seminars/) after the event.

### About the Linkage Seminar Series

About the Linkage Seminar Series: The Massive Data Institute at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy co-hosts monthly Linkage Seminars with the American Statistical Association's Record Linkage Interest Group. These monthly seminars feature interdisciplinary data experts discussing their work on data linkages across data types, sectors, domains, and disciplines.
