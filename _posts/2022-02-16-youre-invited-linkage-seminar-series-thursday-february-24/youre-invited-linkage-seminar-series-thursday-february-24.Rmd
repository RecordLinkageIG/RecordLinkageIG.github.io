### **Thais Menezes** 
Thais Menezes is a Ph.D. student of the SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science (https://www.data-science.ie/) program. She is based in Ireland and her university is the University College Dublin (UCD). Currently, her thesis is regarding Record Linkage and she works with Dt Michael Fop and Professor Brendan Murph - both also from UCD. She is from Brazil and had a bachelor's and a master's degree in statistics. She has some previous work in the Survival Analysis field in which she adapted a Current Status Data model to incorporate Misclassification. During her master's, she worked with the Singular Decomposition Value theorem to find latent maps for cancers databases from different countries. She also has experience working as a statistician at a bank and at a marketing company. She loves to work developing models and methodologies that require a strong computational base and she loves to code using R and Python.
