```


#### Some stats

- RLIG's blog has **`r nrow(posts)`** posts since **`r min(lubridate::as_date(dates))`**.

- The last post was published **`r days_last_post`** days ago ([`r titles[1]`](`r links[1]`)).


```{r plot-obj, fig.height=1, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
# Create plot object
posts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lubridate::as_date(dates), y = 1)) +
  geom_point(shape = "|", size = 5,   color = "#f95355") + 
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # creates the light gray box around the plot ----
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(0, 10, 0, 10)
  ) +
  ggtitle("Published posts history")
```

## Contribution Instructions

The blog is based on [Distill for Rmarkdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), an [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) extension for scientific and technical writing on the web.

There are two ways to contribute to this blog:

1. Contact [Olivier Binette](https://olivierbinette.github.io/) to get a blog post published from any source. This blog post can be written in text format, markdown format, rmarkdown format, or another format without complicated formatting.
2. If you have familiarity with Rmarkdown and Github, you can follow the steps below to directly contribute to the blog. 


### System configuration

Make sure you have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed (you can separately install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) instead of RStudio). You will also need to install the following packages in R:

```r
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "distill"))
```

### Creating a new post

Follow these steps to create a new post:

1. Fork the Github repository [https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io](https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io)
2. Create a new RStudio project from version control, using the forked repository url. Alternatively, clone the forked repository and `cd` into it.
3. Use the following R command to create a new post:

```r
distill::create_post("My Post Title")
```

4. This will create a new folder, named after the current date and provided post title, in the `_posts` directory. This folder contains an Rmarkdown document for you to edit.
5. Edit the Rmarkdown document, referring to [https://rstudio.github.io/distill/](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) for help with formatting and metadata options. You may also use previous posts as templates.
6. Run the following R command to render your blog post as an html file:

```r
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

7. Commit, push, and create a pull request on [https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io](https://github.com/RecordLinkageIG/RecordLinkageIG.github.io).

The pull request will be reviewed before your post is published on RLIG's blog.
